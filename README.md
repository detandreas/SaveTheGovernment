## System Requirements

- **Java**: Version 21 or latest
- **Maven**: Version 3.9.6 or latests
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Installation

### 1.  Repository Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/detandreas/SaveTheGoverment.git
cd SaveTheGoverment
```
### 2. Requirements Check
Make sure that you have installed Java 21 and Maven:
```bash
java -version    # It should display the version 21
mvn -version     #  It should display the version 3.9.6 or latest
```
## Running the Application

### Compile the program.
```bash
mvn clean verify # Executes the full build lifecycle:
                 # - Runs all unit tests
                 # - Generates JaCoCo code coverage reports
                 # - Runs Checkstyle code quality checks
                 # - Generates project documentation
                 # - Compiles source files
./mvnw clean verify
```

### Method 1: With Maven (It is recommended)

```bash
mvn javafx:run # If you have Maven installed on your computer
```
### Method 2: With Maven Wrapper

```bash
./mvnw javafx:run    # Linux/macOS
mvnw.cmd javafx:run   # Windows
```
## Software Patterns
- **Singleton pattern:** It is used for uniqueness Prime Minister
- **DI (Dependency Injection):** It is mainly used in the communication of the Services <-> Repositories
- **Repository Design Pattern:**  For clear separation of data and business logic
- **MVC Architecture (Model View Controller):** For efficient management of the GUI

## Algorithms

### Security
- **SHA-256:** Cryptographic hashing algorithm for secure password storage in users.json
  - Implemented in `PasswordUtils.java`
  - Provides one-way encryption for user authentication

### Data Analysis & Statistics
- **Linear Regression:** Custom implementation for trend forecasting and budget prediction
  - Implemented in `Regression.java`
  - Calculates slope and intercept using least squares method
  - Used for predicting future budget trends in statistics charts

### Input Validation
- **Regular Expressions (Regex):** Pattern matching for input validation
  - Username validation: Alphanumeric characters and underscores
  - Password strength: Minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters
  - Full name validation: Latin characters, proper capitalization
  - UUID format validation
  - Implemented in `InputValidator.java`

### Data Operations
- **Filtering & Sorting:** Dynamic table data manipulation
  - Used in budget tables, pending changes, and change history views
  - Supports multi-criteria filtering
  
- **Stream Processing:** Java 8 Streams for efficient data aggregation
  - Statistical calculations (sum, average, min, max)
  - Budget item grouping by ministry
  - Implemented across service layer

### Data Structures
- **JSON Parsing:** Efficient data serialization/deserialization using Gson
  - Budget data, user credentials, pending changes
  - Repository pattern for data persistence

## API / Code Documentation (Javadoc)

The project uses standard Javadoc comments for documenting
its public API.

### Generate Javadoc
To generate the API documentation, run:

```bash
./mvnw javadoc:javadoc
```

### Read API Documentation
```bash
open target/site/apidocs/index.html 
```
